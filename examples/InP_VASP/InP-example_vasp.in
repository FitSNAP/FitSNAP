##  VASP scraper directions
##  =======================
##  This scraper takes OUTCAR files, extracts all completed ionic steps (called 'configurations'), and creates dictionary objects for each one.
##  On the first FitSNAP run, the scraper will write JSON files for each configuration and use those for subsequent FitSNAP runs.
##  This is to save time in file I/O for FitSNAP (OUTCARs have a lot of extra text and can be very large files).
##
##      To set up this scraper:
##          0. Make sure all the OUTCAR files you want to include are named simply OUTCAR. 
##             Each one MUST be contained in at least one directory but can be at arbitrary directory depth.
##             This structure was chosen to mirror default VASP input and output structure (i.e., 'all_simulations/unique_simulation_1/.../*CAR')
##          1. In the [SCRAPER] section, set 'scaper = VASP'
##          2. Create a *data root directory* in the same place as your FitSNAP input file 
##                  --> Here, that directory is ./VASP
##          3. In the [PATH] section, set 'datapath = {your_root_directory}' (in this example, 'VASP')
##          4. Inside the data root directory (datapath), create one or more *group directories* 
##                  --> Here, there are 3 groups, 'Defects_aP', 'Defects_iP', and 'smallDefects_aa'
##          5. Inside of each group directory, place *VASP run directories* OR *symlinks to those directories* that you would like to train on, i.e., 'all_simulations/unique_simulation_1/.../*CAR'
##                  --> Here, each group has a few different subfolders with OUTCARs, such as './VASP/Defects_aP/type1/OUTCAR'
##          6. In the [GROUPS] section, add the group directories that you would like to include in your fit 
##                  --> Here, all three example groups are included, but you only need a single group folder to perform a fit
##                  --> Please see the FitSNAP documentation to learn more about train/test splitting, group energy and force weights, etc.
##          7. Run FitSNAP (see other documentation for how to do this)
##
##      Expected default scraper output: 
##          FitSNAP will create a new directory (default vJSON), with FitSNAP-formatted JSON file(s) named after the group and (sub)directories where the OUTCAR was located
##                  --> Example: if the OUTCAR was found in 'VASP/some_group/subdir1/subdir2/OUTCAR' and has 3 configurations, the JSONs will be named
##                      'VASP_some_group_subdir1_subdir2_1.json', 'VASP_some_group_subdir1_subdir2_2.json', and 'VASP_some_group_subdir1_subdir2_3.json' 
##          
##          The scraper will crash if an OUTCAR configuration is found not to run to completion (for example, a run was interrupted before converging a relaxation)
##
##      Optional scraper variables in [GROUPS] section (if not included below, defaut values are used):
##          vasp_json_pathname (type <str>, default vJSON)
##                  --> The user can set the new directory name through the variable 'vasp_json_pathname' in the [GROUPS] section
##          vasp_ignore_incomplete (type <bool>, default False) 
##                  --> If True or 1, ignore incomplete OUTCAR configurations (warning will still be thrown)
##                      All other viable configurations will be included in the fit. The configuration number of the incompete one will be skipped over.
##                      Use with caution! Uncomment 'Defects_iP_crash' group below and set this to False for an example of crash behavior.
##          vasp_ignore_jsons (type <bool>, default False) 
##                  --> If True or 1, ignore any created JSONs, forcing the VASP scraper to read all OUTCARs for every FitSNAP run.
##                      Strongly not recommended, may lead to major slowdowns and/or file I/O issues        
##          vasp_use_TOTEN (type <bool>, default False) 
##                  --> If True or 1, the scraper will grab the 'free energy  TOTEN =' line (energy with entropy) per ionic step
##                      Otherwise, defaults to grabbing 'energy without entropy' value 2 lines lower
##          vasp_unconverged_label (type <str>, default 'UNCONVERGED') 
##                  --> User can change the string for the JSON label of unconverged configurations. 
##                      Can also be set to '' to eliminate labels for unconverged configurations (not recommended!)
##
##  Note: This is the first iteration of the VASP scraper. Many improvements are planned and suggestions are very welcome!
##  Final note: This InP example is meant *only* to show how to use the VASP scraper!
##              These fits are *not at all* equivalent to the InP SNAP from the InP_JPCA2020 example (limited data)!
